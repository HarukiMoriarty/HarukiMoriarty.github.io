Now, I'm a Ph.D. student at UW-Madison. My research is focused on database (hope so :) ). I also interested in operating systems and Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF).

Before UW-Madison, I received a B.Eng. in Computer Science from ShanghaiTech University in 2024. I visited UW-Madison in 2023, advised by Xiangyao Yu.
